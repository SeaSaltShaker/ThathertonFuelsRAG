  "Summary": "The Microsoft Graph Mail data enables developers to access and manage Outlook mail data, including emails, calendar events, and personal contacts. With the right permissions, apps can perform tasks such as reading, sending, and organizing messages, as well as automating workflows to handle incoming emails based on specific criteria. This data supports various message formats, including HTML, text, and MIME, providing flexibility in how emails are handled. Additionally, it allows interaction with well-known folders like Inbox, Drafts, Sent Items, and Deleted Items, making it easier to organize and categorize messages.",
